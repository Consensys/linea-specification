The \textbf{block data} module \btcMod{} is the \zkEvm{}'s storage place for \evm{}-relevant block data of the blocks in a conflation.
As such it serves the \hubMod{} data to the following instructions:
\begin{multicols}{3}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \inst{COINBASE}
		\item \inst{TIMESTAMP}
		\item \inst{NUMBER}
		\item \inst{PREVRANDAO}
		\item \inst{GASLIMIT}
		\item \inst{CHAINID}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
Along with the \textsc{rom} and the \textsc{transaction data} module it serves as an entry point of outside data into the \zkEvm{}.
As such one of its duties is to make sure the data it serves is correctly segmented (i.e. satisfies size constraints.)
