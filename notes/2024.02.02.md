# Meeting notes

## Olivier

Quick update on implementation:
- HUB implementation is wip (mainly precompile specific stuff)
- thorough review of MMU before implementation
- EXP module implementation

## Joanne

- Fully verified the updated WCP
- Signed instructions were harder than others
- Observation:
	- You may not need ACC_4/5
	- same for ACC_2/3
	- We may need to homogenize these accumulators
- Template in place for such modules in place for proof structure
- WRT variable length instructions
- ADD, BIN, SHF
- CT_MAX being nondeterministic has an impact ?
	- now verification time of 24s
	- new structure for the loops
	- not a huge difference from the Tools perspective

Set up the basics for STP

## David

- Adding features to the tool
- Corset advances faster than tool : )
- Type inference in Corset
- ADD module functional correctness done
- WCP module a lot of time in it
- Signed instructions killed Dafny for David
- Had to revamp parts of it
- BIN pondering how to deal with lookup tables / bitwise operations in Dafny
- Boils down to an assumption that the lookup tables are correct

Spec questions:
- Consistency questions around the spec / constraints
- THETA and THETA_2 
- Purpose of debug constraints ?
	- Olivier: 2 purposes
		- signal constraints that are not required per se (e.g. vanishing of counter's and max counters during the padding)
		- formal consequence of other things (e.g. they _should_ follow implicitly from other constraints, e.g. columns that are binary by construction don't need to be verified to be so)
- For audit the 2 use cases of debug may be confusing

## General discussion

Formal verification:
- will become part of communication of Linea
	- talks, blog posts, tweets ... papers ?
- very interesting point (raised by Madeline M. and communicated here by Joanne):
	- unusual for FV to be happening in parallel with specification / implementation
	- developing tools to deal with evolving specification
