# Meeting notes 2024.02.09

## Olivier

- implementation progress:
	- HUB: did the Java implemnetation of
		- CALL's and CREATE's
		- precompiles
		- interfacing with other modules (OOB/EXP/MMU/...) for these 'instructions'
	- MMU v2 implementation has started
	- MMIO spec update will likely start soon, too
	- EXP is in the testing phase

## Alex

- completing BIN module
- updating proof scripts to work with uninterpreted functions
- works
- performance still an issue
- model checking vs inductive proofs
- adding auxiliary properties adds a lot of work to the prover
- plan to implement inductive proofs for BIN
- BIN not that complicated but inductive proofs require properties
	- the more properties you have the harder the proofs become for the prover
	- SMT struggles with big formulas
- for ADD there are only 2 operations, for BIN there are at least 5 ... this has an impact on the complexity
- work on transpiler from Python (execution spec) to generate properties (e.g. type annotations)
- doing type inference in Python

## Joanne

- adjusting approach: row by row now rather than blocks of rows
- a lot of previous proofs translated easily to the new strategy
- more exploratory with defining properties maybe ?
- some comments on the BTC_DATA module
	- ยง2.3: Note is wrong (wrong i + 2 should be i)
	- counter constancy is stated but not specified
- Will take a look at stateful modules (e.g. MXP) next week
- continue with STP, too.


## David

- spent some time on the Corset -> Dafny tool
- made changes that allow you to be more specific how Dafny instantiates the constraints
	- you can now e.g. instantiate only a subset of the constraints at row k and another subset at row k-1
- this has had an impact
	- ADD now verifies in a couple of seconds without user
- `:binary@prove` improves stuff in WCP
- SHF: looking at the BYTE instruction
- prototyped a translation of the constraints into Lean
	- doesn't look too bad (no proofs yet, just constraints and properties)
	- Lean could give us some advantages (Note: I didn't catch which ones)
- updated the report (FI โก forward induction)
- will share updated version of the report next week most likely
- in a FI you want to know all the constraints at point k
- if you are in the inductive case you also want the constraints to be instantiated at k-1
- the report still has to describe how we do backward induction

## Discussion

- **Olivier to Alex**: is the BIN module more difficult?
	- modules such as BIN are why uninterpreted functions were introduced
	- same issue arises for SHF (but didn't require uninterpreted functions)
	- we have functions that work on the byte-level, how it doesn't matter, will work for all NOT, AND, OR, XOR, ...
	- uninterpreted functions allow to hide complexity and introduce an axiomatic approach instead
	- simplifies complexity and will remain important in the future
	- another option would be to translate to bit vectors of fixed length
- Question: there is some interest within the arithmetization team (e.g. Lorenzo) to partake in the formal verification effort. Obviously not before our work is done, e.g. by May 1. How, if at all, will we be able to contribute at some point ?
	- David: Tools are still very clunky. Working on some module properties could be a place to start.
	- Alex: BMC is rather easy to step in. Performance issues are tricky though, and speeding things up requires understanding how it works (the BMC I take it). Properties for modules that aren't constraints, there additional manpower could make sense.
	- Alex: simplified modules (3 or 4 rows rather than 16) would make perf issues simpler.
	- [ ] Alex: We can have a session to look at simple modules like ADD / EUC / ...
	- Alex: **Model checking could become a part of the module specification process** to verify that properties are enforced by constraints. Especially using the same corset files + properties within the corset files
