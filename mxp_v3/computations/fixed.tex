\begin{verbatim}
The ``fixed size'' stuff doesn't really make sense anymore.
It should be subsumed in the ``one max offset'' stuff.
There should nonetheless be some sanity check, derived potentially from the ID, that the sizes are as expected:
- MLOAD: 32
- MSTORE: 32
- MSTORE8: 1

To enforce the above we will make use of the binary columns
- decoder/IS_FIXED_SIZE_32 (valid only for MLOAD/MSTORE)
- decoder/IS_FIXED_SIZE_1  (valid only for MSTORE8)
\end{verbatim}
