We describe the approach to deciding which computations to carry out.
The $\isMxpScenario$-row preceding the first $\isMxpComputation$-row is instrumental in setting this question,
and all computation constraints will be expressed relative the row index of said scenario-row.
The binary columns pertaining to said perspective must be understood as \textbf{predictions} as to which computation is required by the current $\isMxpMacro$-instruction.
Thus the constraints that follow have to both
(\emph{a}) follow the computation laid out by the scenario row and
(\emph{b}) justify the prediction.

% Observe that the $\isMxpMacro$-instruction-row (and the associated instruction-decoding-row) already imposes certain constraints on the scenario-row.
Recall from
section~(\ref{mxp: constraints: generalities: scenario})
that both $\mxpScenarioMsize$ and $\mxpScenarioMxpx$ are already fully constrained and determined,
see constraints~(\ref{mxp: constraints: generalities: scenario: setting scn/MSIZE})
and~(\ref{mxp: constraints: generalities: scenario: setting scn/MXPX})
respectively.
