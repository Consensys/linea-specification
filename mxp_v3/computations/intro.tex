We describe the approach to deciding which computations to carry out.
The $\isMxpScenario$-row preceding the first $\isMxpComputation$-row is instrumental in setting this question,
and all computation constraints will be expressed relative the row index of said scenario-row.
The binary columns pertaining to said perspective must be understood as \textbf{predictions} as to which computation is required by the current $\isMxpMacro$-instruction.
Thus the constraints that follow have to both
(\emph{a}) follow the computation laid out by the scenario row and
(\emph{b}) justify the prediction.

We start with some high-level generalities.
