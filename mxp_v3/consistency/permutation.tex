Consider a row permutation $\col{X}\rightsquigarrow\order{\col{X}}$ such that the rows of the following columns are listed in lexicographic order:
\[
	\Big(
	\order{\isMxpScenario},
	\order{\cn},
	\order{\mxpStamp}
	\Big)
\]
Such a row permutation achieves that all scenario-rows are listed contiguously at the end of the trace.
Furthermore within the scenario rows those rows pertaining to a given execution context are contiguous and chronologically sorted.
