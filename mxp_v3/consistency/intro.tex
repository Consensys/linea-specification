The purpose of the consistency argument for the \mxpMod{} is to guarantee that both
the active number of words in memory ($\bm{\mu}_i$ in the \cite{EYP}, $\mxpScenarioWords$ here) and
the accrued memory expansion cost ($C_\text{mem}(\bm{\mu}_i)$ in the \cite{EYP}, $\mxpScenarioCmem$ here)
behave coherently through out.
