The purpose of the consistency argument for the \mxpMod{} module is to guarantee consistency of the \textbf{internal state} of the module
across execution contexts and over time, i.e. of
the active number of words in memory ($\mxpScenarioWords$) and
the accrued memory expansion cost ($\mxpScenarioCmem$.)
