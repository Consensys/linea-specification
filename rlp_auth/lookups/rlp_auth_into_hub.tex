The purpose of the $\rlpAuthMod \hookrightarrow \hubMod$ lookup is to extract the $\rlpAuthMacroAuthorityNonce$.
Furthermore, this lookup is the means by which the \hubMod{} learns about authority tuples, whether valid or invalid.
% TODO: @OLIVIER: we need an inverse lookup from HUB to RLP_AUTH to make sure we don't add extra delegations
% TODO: @OLIVIER: we need a new transaction execution phase in the HUB, which we should name TXN_AUTH (like TXN_WARM) to deal with authorization tuples
% TODO: @OLIVIER: we need an indexing mechanism for tuples for which ecrecovery was successful to prevent "double authorizations" or what not (likely impossible but ok) in the HUB
