The first portion of processing an authorization list item is to perform various checks.
These checks fall into two categories:
\textbf{mandatory checks} that express that the
authorization list tuple is \textbf{well-formed}.
These checks are characterized by the requirement that they all pass (\resultMustBeTrueName).
\textbf{Validity checks} determine whether the authorization tuple is acted upon during transaction pre-processing.
Contrary to the first batch the required comparisons may or may not hold.
