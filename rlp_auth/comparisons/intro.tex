The first portion of processing an authorization list item is to perform various checks.
These checks fall into two categories:
\textbf{mandatory checks} that express that the
authorization list tuple is \textbf{well-formed} and
\textbf{validity checks} that may or may not hold and determine whether the authorization tuple
is acted upon during transaction pre-processing.
