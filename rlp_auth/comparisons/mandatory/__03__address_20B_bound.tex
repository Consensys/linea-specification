\mandatoryComparisonsStandingHypothesis{}
We impose that
\[
	\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
		\wcpCallToLt  {
			anchorRow = i                         ,
			relOffset = \roffCompMandatoryAddress ,
			argOneHi  = \locAddressHi             ,
			argOneLo  = \locAddressLo             ,
			argTwoHi  = 256^4                     ,
			argTwoLo  = 0                         ,
		}
		\vspace{2mm}
		\\
		\resultMustBeTrue {
			anchorRow = i                         ,
			relOffset = \roffCompMandatoryAddress ,
		}
	\end{array} \right.
\]
\saNote{}
The above ensures that the authorization tuple
\locAddress{},
as given by its hi/lo decomposition
\locAddressHi{} / \locAddressLo{},
is well formed as an address $\in \mathbb{B} _{\addressSize}$.
