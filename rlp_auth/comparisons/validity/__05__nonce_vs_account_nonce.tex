\nonceAgreementStandingHypothesis{}

We impose that
\[
	\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
		\wcpCallToEq  {
			anchorRow = i                                          ,
			relOffset = \roffCompValidityNonceVsAccountNonce       ,
			argOneHi  = 0                                          ,
			argOneLo  = \locNonce                                  ,
			argTwoHi  = 0                                          ,
			argTwoLo  = \locAuthorityNonce + \locAuthorityIsSender ,
		}
		\vspace{2mm}
		\\
		\locNonceEqualsAuthorityNonce \define \rlpAuthComputationRes _{i + \roffCompValidityNonceVsAccountNonce}
	\end{array} \right.
\]
\saNote{}\label{rlp auth: comparisons: validity: nonce vs account nonce: when authority is sender}
Thus we have
\begin{enumerate}
        \item \If $\locAuthorityIsSender = \false$ \Then \[ \locNonceEqualsAuthorityNonce = \true ~\iff~ \locNonce = \locAuthorityNonce \]
        \item \If $\locAuthorityIsSender = \true$  \Then \[ \locNonceEqualsAuthorityNonce = \true ~\iff~ \locNonce = \locAuthorityNonce + 1 \]
\end{enumerate}
We provide some background for this particular constraint.
We first point out that our processing of authority lists in the \hubMod{} module happens \textbf{before} the transaction induced
incrementation of the sender nonce.
We next recall that, as per \cite{EIP-7702},
the processing the authority list should happen \textbf{after} the transaction induced sender nonce update.
This poses a difficulty if the authority-list transaction includes authority tuples signed by the transaction's sender.
For such a tuple to be valid it is necessary that the (tuple's) nonce be greater by one
than the nonce in the sender's account at the time of processing of said tuple \textbf{in the \hubMod{} module}.
We note furthermore that the sender's nonce continuously updates in the \hubMod{} with every valid
authority tuple (for which the sender is the \authority{}).
Therefore the sender's nonce will only every lag behind by $1$ in the processing of valid authority tuples
(for which the sender is the \authority{}).
