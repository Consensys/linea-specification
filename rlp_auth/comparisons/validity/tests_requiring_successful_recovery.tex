The following tests are only meaningful if $\rlpAuthMacroAuthorityRecovery _{i + \roffCompMacroRow} = \true$.
Indeed, the \textbf{authority account parameters},
specifically the \locAuthorityAddress{} and the \locAuthorityNonce{} parameters
are only meaningful in case of \macroEcrecover{} success.
However, the \rlpAuthMod{} module carries these tests out regardless of recovery success.
There is no harm in setting \locAuthorityAddress{} and \locAuthorityNonce{} to zero in that case.
The resulting ``result bits'' are similarly meaningless and will not be used in what follows.
