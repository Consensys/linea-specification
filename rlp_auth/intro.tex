The \rlpAuthMod{} module carries out the analysis of individual
\textbf{authorization tuples} of \textbf{set code transactions}
(i.e. $\typeFourTx$ transactions)
as specified in \cite{EIP-7702}
and as required by the \rlpTxnMod{} module.

The present module parses \textbf{all} \user{}-transactions regardless of their (transaction) type.
Transactions whose underlying type doesn't support \textbf{authorization lists}
($\transactionTypeSansAuthorityLists{} \equiv 1$)
have ``trivial'' processing,
while those that do
($\transactionTypeWithAuthorityLists{} \equiv 1$)
have more involved processing.
Unsurprisingly we deal with authorization lists by
dealing with their authorization tuples sequentially.
The processing of any one authorization tuple
takes place over a block of contiguous rows.
Processing involves various \textbf{mandatory} comparisons,
as well as other \textbf{validity} checks.
These checks determine
\begin{description}
	\item[\underline{\underline{Determining \rlpAuthExternAuthorityEcrecoverAttempt{}:}}]
		several of the \textbf{validity} checks, taken together, determine the
		\rlpAuthExternAuthorityEcrecoverAttempt{} bit.
	\item[\underline{\underline{Attempting \macroEcrecover{}:}}]
		whenever $\rlpAuthExternAuthorityEcrecoverAttempt \equiv \true$
		the module attempts to \macroEcrecover{} the \locAuthority{} address;
		this requires computing the following byte string
		\[
			\begin{array}{lcl}
				\texttt{msg} & \equiv &
				\locMagicByte
				~ \cdot ~
				\rlp\Big( \big[ \locChainId, \locAddress, \locNonce \big] \Big) \vspace{2mm} \\
				& \equiv &
				\locMagicByte
				~ \cdot ~
				\rlp\Big(
				\rlp\big( \locChainId \big) \, \cdot \,
				\rlp\big( \locAddress \big) \, \cdot \,
				\rlp\big( \locNonce   \big)
				\Big)
				\\
			\end{array}
		\]
		which is supposedly signed in the authority tuple.
		The success (or failure) of this attempt is recorded in
		\rlpAuthExternAuthorityRecoverySuccess{};
		if address recovery failed no meaningful \locAuthority{} address exists.
	\item[\underline{\underline{Extracting \hubMod{} information:}}]
		whenever $\rlpAuthExternAuthorityRecoverySuccess \equiv \true$, the
		\locAuthorityAddress{} is meaningful and the present module queries the \hubMod{}
		to extract the associated \locAuthorityNonce{}.
		At this point the module can check the validity of the authority tuple \locNonce{}
		and thus compute \rlpAuthExternAuthorityTupleIsValid{}
	\item[\underline{\underline{Computing the new ``\codeHash{}'':}}]
		if $\rlpAuthExternAuthorityTupleIsValid \equiv \true$ then the \locAuthority{}'s
		``code'' and \codeHash{} must be updated as well as its code hash;
		\[
			\col{code}
			\equiv
			\locAthorizationCodePrefix
			~ \cdot ~
			\address
		\]
