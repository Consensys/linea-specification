We impose the following constraints on \membershipTestRequired{}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \membershipTestRequired{} is \textbf{counter-constant, binary} \quad (\trash)
    \item \If $\membershipTestRequired_{i} = 1$ \Then
        \[
            \left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
                \internalChecksPassed _{i} & = & 1 \\
                \isLargePoint_{i}          & = & 1 \\
            \end{array} \right.
        \]
\end{enumerate}
\saNote{} The purpose of \membershipTestRequired{} is twofold:
(\emph{a}) in case the present module predicts that some point in the data of a call to the \instEcpairing{} precompile is not on $G_2$ the \membershipTestRequired{} flag selects that point, see section~(\ref{prc: ec data: successful pairing: setting G2 non membership})
(\emph{b}) in case the present module predicts that all points in the data of the same call are on $G_2$ the \membershipTestRequired{} flag selects for every pair of points $(P,Q)$ those $Q$ whose accompanying $P$ is the point at infinity, see section~(\ref{prc: ec data: successful pairing: setting membershipTestRequired}).
