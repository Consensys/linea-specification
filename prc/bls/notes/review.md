# OOB

- Formatting;

# BLS

- Split utils wellformed + infinity; Ok, modulo formatting
- Removed PART_CHECKS; Ok
- Updated tables; Ok
- Do we still need INTERNAL_CHECK_PASSED?

- Change the style of the tables by following what we did in G1MSMS and G2ADD (pairs of intpus, 0-1 business, IS_FIRST and IS_SECOND columns, stretch, remove ..., CT should follow INDEX in the result rows)
- Move big tables into standalone files and include PDFs
- e_a, e_b -> e_Im, e_Re
