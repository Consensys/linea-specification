# EIP-5656: MCOPY - Memory copying instruction

## Impact

- HUB
    - misc/MXP
        - requires double compute of the new memory size (like `CALL`'s)
        - requires also detecting zero size
    - misc/MMU
        - these operations would be carried out in 0 or two steps, like the IDENTITY precompile
        - first copy over data to fictious execution context
        - then transfer value back

Thus two distinct MMU operations of the form `ramToRamSansPadding` (or whatever.)
