# EIP-1153: Transient storage opcodes

## Impact

- TSTORE/TLOAD likely to be included among the STORAGE instruction family
- with similar logic to STORAGE perspective (in particular wrt undoing)
    - simpler as uniform pricing
    - no associated refunds, no warmth
    - no required comparison gas vs G_stipend = 2_300
- there is ONE difference though, in that the ABS_TX_NUM intervenes in the consistency argument
- new TRANSIENT perspective
    - likely safer not to mix it with the STORAGE perspective
    - will require its own (simple) consistency argument

## Notes

## Test vectors

- make tests parametric so that we can use both [S/T][STORE/LOAD]
    - static stuff
    - multi frame tests
- we need multitransaction tests
- stack underflow, static, out of gas
