- with similar logic to STORAGE perspective (in particular wrt undoing)
    - simpler as uniform pricing
    - no associated refunds, no warmth
    - no required comparison gas vs G_stipend = 2_300
- new TRANSIENT perspective
    - likely safer not to mix it with the STORAGE perspective
    - will require its own (simple) consistency argument
