# EIP-4844: Shard Blob Transactions

## Impact

- new transaction type
- precompiles
- new opcode (BLOBHASH)

## Notes

- blob transactions (type 3) are not as of January 21
- no data on the precompile
- the BLOBHASH opcode, given that there are no blob transactions, could be supported and return 0

Blobhash should not be supported by the header
