# EIP-4788: Beacon block root in the EVM

## Impact

## Notes

From the [Block processing](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788#block-processing) section

> Clients may decide to omit an explicit EVM call and directly set the storage values. Note: While this is a valid optimization for Ethereum mainnet, it could be problematic on non-mainnet situations in case a different contract is used.

So this means we could do this as a special operation at the start of every block

From [The Beacon Chain Ethereum 2.0 explainer you need to read first](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain#:~:text=Slots%20and%20Epochs,is%2032%20slots%3A%206.4%20minutes.)

> A slot is a chance for a block to be added to the Beacon Chain. Every 12 seconds, one block is added when the system is running optimally. Validators do need to be roughly synchronized with time.
>
> A slot is like the block time, but slots can be empty. The Beacon Chain genesis block is at Slot 0

It seems that one way to do this would be to have a new TX_BCNRT (better: BLK_BCNRT) phase which would consist of
- a MISC/OOB row where we perform something like t â‰¡ TIMESTAMP mod 8191
- a STORAGE row where we insert the TIMESTAMP at t, and BEACON_ROOT at t + 8191
- maybe we need a TXN root and we must insert the BEACON_ROOT into the TXN_DATA module

Question: how do you initially deploy the SMC ?
