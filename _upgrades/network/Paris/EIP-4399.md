# EIP-4399: Supplant DIFFICULTY opcode with PREVRANDAO

## Impact

The `PREVRANDAO` value will be in the block header. As such its value should be included into the `BLOCKDATA` module thus replacing the `DIFFICULTY` field.

## Notes

The `PREVRANDAO` opcode will be made part of the `BTC` instruction family. Renaming the `DIFFICULTY` and potentially adjusting its gas cost should suffice.

## Test vectors

- stackOverflow
- OOGX with nonzero `PREVRANDAO`
