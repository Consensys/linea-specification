  - add phase column for delegation TX_DELEGATION
  - add columns in account perspective for IS_DELEGATED, DELEGATION_ADDRESS
  - call scenarios
  - extra account rows for calls targetting delegated accounts
  - context initialization depending on delegated / non delegated
- TXN_DATA
  - pricing
  - check that it's not a deployment transaction
  - authorization list cannot be empty
