# EIP-7702: Set EOA account code

## Impact

- RLP_TXN, new tx type
  - new RLPization AUTHORITY_RLP
  - send the RLPization + signature to the prover
- HUB
  - add phase column for delegation TX_DELEGATED
  - pre-check for delegation of delegation
  > In case a delegation designator points to another designator, creating a potential chain or loop of designators, clients must retrieve only the first code and then stop following the designator chain.`
  - add phase column for delegation TX_DELEGATION
  - add columns in account perspective for IS_DELEGATED, DELEGATION_ADDRESS
  - call scenarios
  - extra account rows for calls targeting delegated accounts
  - context initialization depending on delegated / non delegated
- TXN_DATA
  - pricing
  - check that it's not a deployment transaction
  - authorization list cannot be empty

## Notes

If execution fails, delegation is persistent

## Test vectors

- delegation remains if execution fails
- test several times EOA in same tx
- persistent between transactions
- cannot sign with an address that is delegated
- multidelegation calls
- resetting the delegation / re-enabling transaction signing
- if the smart contract address is a precompile, and raise exception when execution calls it
