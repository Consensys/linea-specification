# EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations

## Impact

- Add precompiles in EC_DATA
- Expand EC_DATA with a two step comparison done by WCP module to account for operations on 48 bytes 
- on HUB and OOB

## Notes

Annoying work but should be ok

## Test vectors

- testing all the precompiles failing
