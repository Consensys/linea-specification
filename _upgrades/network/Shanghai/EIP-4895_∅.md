# EIP-4895: Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations

## Impact

None

How will it fail ? 
- a block with a withdrawal is invalid: if Besu/Geth receive a block with withdrawals, it will try to execute it

## Notes

- We don't want to allow withdrawals from L1 staking via Linea
- Withdrawals are only going to be for Linea staking and will be done via transactions and not system operations
