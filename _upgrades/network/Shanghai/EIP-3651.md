# EIP-3651: Warm COINBASE

## Impact

This will affect the TX_INIT phase of the HUB.
A single extra row during that phase to warm up the COINBASE address will suffice.
In terms of implementation it will suffice to modify said section.
We will have to track the warmth of the COINBASE address during the pre-warming phase
We will also have to be on the lookout for address collisions, again for up to 3 addresses (like in the old TX_FINL section.)

## Notes

## Test vectors

We need to test interactions between:
- prewarming (yes/no)
- address collisions between sender/recipient/coinbase
- tests where the COINBASE gets touched during the execution (smc1)
- warmth stability under rollbacks
    - write a test where within some internal transaction (callStackDepth > 0, to smc2) we touch the COINBASE
    - this internal transaction eventually fails
    - we touch the COINBASE from the root context of the transaction


```rust
// smc1
...
COINBASE
...
BALANCE / CALL-type / EXTCODE[HASH/SIZE/COPY] (some with with extra parameters) / SELFDESTRUCT
```

Sample code for the internal transaction
```rust
// smc2
COINBASE
BALANCE
INVALID
```
