# EIP-3860: Limit and meter initcode

## Impact

TXN_DATA, likely
    - the canonical place where to verify that a transaction's INIT_CODE_SIZE is ≤ 49152 (i.e. 0xC000)
    - also where to compute the ceiling computation for ⌊ TX_INIT_CODE_SIZE / 32 ⌋
OOB (extra check for CREATEE/CREATE2 instructions, likely aborting condition, to be verified)
    - likely best place to check for the upper bound on init code size
STP (pricing of CREATE/CREATE2)
    - likely best place to compute the relevant floor
HUB (CREATE/CREATE2 instruction processing)
    - probably unaffected, except maybe in its interfaces with OOB/STP

## Notes

The RLP_TXN module seems like it would be unaffected.

## Test vectors

- existing testvectors for deployment (tx/int. tx)
- aborting condition tests
