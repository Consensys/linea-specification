\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\trmStamp$:
		stamp column; starts at $0$ and grows by 1 with every served request; like many other stamp columns its main purpose is to separate the different requests to that module;
	\item $\first$:
		bit column that lights up precisely at the first row of all counter-loop;
	\item $\rawAddrHi$ and $\rawAddrLo$:
		\godGiven{}
		\ccc{}; contains the high and low part of some stack value which ought to be interpreted as an address;
	\item $\trmAddrHi$:
		\godGiven{}
		\ccc{}; contains the trimmed version of the high part of the address argument;
	\item $\trmLeadHi$:
		\ccc{}; contains the leading bytes of the high part of the address argument;
	\item $\isPrecompile$:
		\godGiven{}
		\ccbc{}; equals $1$ \emph{if and only if} the trimmed address is in the range $\{1, 2,\dots, \maxPrecompileAddress\}$;
	\item $\ct$:
		counter column: counts continuously from $0$ to $\locCtMaxTrmName$ ($= \locCtMaxTrm$) and resets;
	\item $\argOneHi$, $\argOneLo$, $\argTwoHi$, $\argTwoLo$, $\res$, $\INST$:
		arguments for calls to the \wcpMod{} module;
\end{enumerate}
