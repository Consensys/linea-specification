The main purpose of the \textbf{initialization phase} is for the sender of a transaction
to pay for gas,
to perform the initial value transfer to the recipient,
and to initialize the execution context wherein \evm{} execution will take place.
To that list of actions one should add, whenever the transaction provides nonempty call data,
the transfer of transaction call data (at points abbreviated as \col{TXCD}) to a dedicated memory space.
Furthermore, very much like for \inst{CALL}-type and \inst{CREATE}-type instructions,
the initialization phase may include ``undoing operations'' related to certain of its own account-related actions.
Such ``undoing operations'' are included \emph{if and only if} the transaction is predicted to revert.
