\textbf{Storage-rows} are characterized by $\peekStorage \equiv 1$ and columns pertaining to that perspective are prefixed with the following symbol: $\storageSignifier$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		$\stoAddressHi$,
		$\stoAddressLo$:
		high and low parts of an account address;
	\item
		$\stoDeploymentNumber$:
		currently valid deployment number of said account address;
	\item
		$\stoKeyHi$,
		$\stoKeyLo$:
		high and low parts of a storage key of said account address;
	\item
		$\stoOrigValueHi$,
		$\stoOrigValueLo$:
		high and low parts of the value originally found in storage at the beginning of the transaction;
	\item
		$\stoCurrValueHi$,
		$\stoCurrValueLo$:
		high and low parts of the value currently found at the storage key;
	\item
		$\stoNextValueHi$,
		$\stoNextValueLo$:
		high and low parts of the updated value in storage;
	\item
		$\stoWarmth$,
		$\stoWarmth\new$:
		binary columns containing the storage key's warmth and its updated warmth; 
	\item
		$\stoOrigValueIsZero$,
		$\stoCurrValueIsOrig$,
		$\stoCurrValueIsZero$,
		$\stoNextValueIsCurr$,
		$\stoNextValueIsZero$,
		$\stoNextValueIsOrig$:
		binary columns whose purpose is to streamline the computation of gas costs of \inst{SSTORE} instructions;
\end{enumerate}
The desired interpretation is straightforward:
\[
	\left\{ \begin{array}{lclclcl}
		\stoOrigValueIsZero & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & 1 & \iff & \stoOrigValue & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & 0           \\
		\stoCurrValueIsZero & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & 1 & \iff & \stoCurrValue & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & 0           \\
		\stoNextValueIsZero & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & 1 & \iff & \stoNextValue & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & 0           \\
		\stoCurrValueIsOrig & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & 1 & \iff & \stoCurrValue & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & \stoOrigValue \\
		\stoNextValueIsOrig & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & 1 & \iff & \stoNextValue & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & \stoOrigValue \\
		\stoNextValueIsCurr & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & 1 & \iff & \stoCurrValue & \!\!\! = \!\!\! & \stoNextValue \\
	\end{array} \right.
\]
See section~\ref{hub: storage rows: gas cost binary columns}.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item
		$\stoSloadOperation$,
		$\stoSstoreOperation$:
		binary columns used to record the nature of the operation which have given rise to the current storage-row \emph{if applicable};
\end{enumerate}
\saNote{} \label{hub: storage rows: metadata for the state manager}
The \zkEvm{} may produce storage-rows in the following contexts \emph{only}:
(\emph{a}) when pre-warming a storage key during the pre-warming phase of an access-list transaction, see section~(\ref{hub: prewarming phase}),
(\emph{b}) when processing an \inst{SLOAD} instruction or
(\emph{c}) when processing an \inst{SSTORE} instruction, see section~(\ref{hub: instruction handling: storage: constraints}) for both.
For \textbf{state-manager} related reasons it is useful to retain the nature of the operation which spawned a given storage-row.
This explains the inclusion of both $\stoSloadOperation$ and $\stoSstoreOperation$.
It is furthermore of interest (for the \textbf{state-manager}) to remember if said operation was exceptional (as in: raised an \evm{} exception) or not.
We will come back to that point in more detail in section~(\ref{hub: consistencies: storage}).
