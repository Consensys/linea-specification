\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item \miscMxpMxpx{}:
		bit indicating whether a \mxpxSH{} has taken place;
	\item \miscMxpInst{}:
		\mxpMod{} instruction; 
	\item \miscMxpCodeDeployment{}:
		bit that indicates whether the current context is a deployment context; used to price the ``linear gas cost'' of \inst{RETURN}'s;
	\item \miscMxpOffsetOneHi{} and \miscMxpOffsetOneLo{}:
		high and low part of a first offset parameter;
	\item \miscMxpOffsetTwoHi{} and \miscMxpOffsetTwoLo{}:
		high and low part of a second offset parameter (for \inst{CALL}-type instructions);
	\item \miscMxpSizeOneHi{} and \miscMxpSizeOneLo{}:
		high and low part of a first size parameter;
	\item \miscMxpSizeTwoHi{} and \miscMxpSizeTwoLo{}:
		high and low part of a second size parameter (for \inst{CALL}-type instructions);
	\item \miscMxpWords{}:
		``the active number of words in memory (counting continuously from position $0$)'' \ob{TODO: reference to EYP, 9.4.1. Machine State};
	\item \miscMxpGasMxp{}:
		memory expansion cost + whatever ``linear'' cost the instruction may incur;
	\item \miscMxpTypeFourInstMayTriggerMmu{}
		binary column which may only light up for \mxpMod{} instruction of ``\textbf{type 4}'';
		see section~(\ref{mxp: may trigger non trivial operation});
\end{enumerate}
\saNote{} We don't include a miscellaneous \mxpStamp{} column: such a column is readily available as a shared column.

\saNote{} ``Linear'' costs come in two flavors: gas cost may be proportional to either the size in bytes of one of the parameters or the size in \textsc{evm} words.
