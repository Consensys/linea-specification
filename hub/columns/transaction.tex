\textbf{Transaction-rows} are characterized by $\peekTransaction_{i} \equiv 1$.
Transations specify a number of parameter that influence the execution of transaction.
Transactions go through initial vetting.
Some of that vetting is carried out in the \hubMod{}, some of it is carried out in the \userTxnDataMod{}.
One must check that
(\emph{a}) that the account's balance is sufficient to pay for gas and value to transfer
(\emph{b}) taht the nonce provided in the transaction coincides with that of the sender account as found in the state.
Transaction data is further used to set some initial parameters of the execution environment (such as the address of the account whose bytecode is executed or setting the initial available gas.)
Furthermore transaction data makes its way directly into the execution through opcodes such as \inst{}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txFrom\high$, $\txFrom\low$:
		high and low parts of the sender address of the transaction; deduced from the signature;
	\item

		account nonce $T_\text{n}$ as specified in the transaction;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		\markAsJustifiedHere{}

		if the transaction is a message call transaction (i.e. $T_{\text{t}} \neq \varnothing$) this is $T_{\text{t}}$;

	\item

		binary column which lights up for message call transactions requiring \evm{} execution and being provided with nonempty call data;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txIsDeployment$:
		binary column; equals $0$ \emph{iff} the transaction is a message call ($T_\text{t} \neq \varnothing$); equals $1$ if and only if the transaction is a contract deployment transaction ($T_{\text{t}} = \varnothing$.)
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txIsTypeTwo$:
		binary column which equals $1$ for \textsc{eip1559} transactions only;
	\item

	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txInitialGas$:
		intial gas provided to execution;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txGasPrice$:
		gas price as returned by the \inst{GASPRICE} opcode;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txPriorityFeePerGas$:
		rate at which the \inst{COINBASE} address is paid for consumed gas;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txBasefee$:
		the transaction's (i.e. block's) base fee;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txCallDataSize$:
		contains the size of the call data $\|T_\textbf{d}\|$ when $\txIsDeployment \equiv 0$;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txInitCodeSize$:
		contains the size of the initialization code $\|T_\textbf{i}\|$ when $\txIsDeployment \equiv 1$;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		\markAsJustifiedHere{}
		$\txStatusCode$:
		status code of the transaction; confirmed at the end of transaction processing;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		\markAsJustifiedHere{}
		$\txLeftoverGas$:
		left over gas of the transaction; confirmed at the end of transaction processing;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		\markAsJustifiedHere{}
		$\txFinalRefundCounter$:
		sum total of all (non reverted) gas refunds accumulated during transaction execution; confirmed at transaction end;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txEffectiveRefund$:
		amount of gas to be refunded to the sender $S(T)$ at transaction end;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txCoinbase\high$, $\txCoinbase\low$:
		high and low part of the coinbase address;
\end{enumerate}
\saNote{}
More transaction fields are available in the \userTxnDataMod{} module. The above represents the only fields which are needed in the \hubMod{} module.

\saNote{}
Some of the above are fields that are \emph{extracted} from the \hubMod{} module (at various stages of execution) rather than being provided to it, e.g.
$\txInitialBalance$,
$\txRequiresEvmExecution$
are justified during the transaction initialization phase.
Similarly
$\txStatusCode$,
$\txLeftoverGas$,
$\txFinalRefundCounter$
are justified during the transaction finalization phase.

The following columns bear the $\transactionSignifier$ prefix but will be extracted from the
\systTxnDataMod{} module,
see (\ref)
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		\txnSystemTransactionNoop:
		boolean column;
		lights up for \textsc{noop} system transactions;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		\txnSystemTransactionEipBeaconRoot:
		boolean column;
		lights up for \cite{eip-4788} system transactions;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		\txnSystemTransactionEipBlockHash:
		boolean column;
		lights up for \cite{eip-4788} system transactions;
	\item
		\godGiven{}
		$\txnSystemTransactionDataCol{k}$, $1 \leq k \leq \txnDataHubNumberOfDataColumns$:
		data column used by system transactions;
\end{enumerate}
