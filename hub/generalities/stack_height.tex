We provide partial constraints for the $\height$ and $\height\new$ columns.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Recall that $\height$ and $\height\new$ are hub-stamp-constant, see section~(\ref{hub: heartbeat: constancy conditions})
	\item \If $\txExec_{i} = 0$ \Then $\height_{i} = 0$ and $\height\new _{i} = 0$ \quad (\trash)
	\item \If $\peekStack _{i} = 1$ \Then
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \If $\stackSux _{i} + \stackSox _{i} = 1$ \Then $\height\new _{i} = 0$ \quad (\trash)
		        \item \If $\stackSux _{i} + \stackSox _{i} = 0$ \Then $\height\new _{i} = \height_{i} - \stackDelta + \stackAlpha$
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Changes to $\height$ and $\height\new$ are derived from the sequence of instructions, see
section~(\ref{hub: instruction handling}),
in particular from the relevant stack pattern, see
section~(\ref{hub: stack: patterns}).
The permuted domain further imposes ``linking constraints'', ensuring continuity of stack heights at the boundaries of (execution) context changes, see section~(\ref{hub: consistencies: stack}).

\saNote{}
The $(\trash)$ constraints above reflect the fact that the stack height is irrelevant (undefined, really) outside of transaction execution.
As such there is no reason to impose a ``new height'' if the present instruction raises a stack exception.
Stack exceptions (\suxSH{} and \soxSH{} are detected by means of two lookups $\hubMod\hookrightarrow\wcpMod$, see
section~(\ref{hub: lookups: into wcp for stack underflow}) and
section~(\ref{hub: lookups: into wcp for stack overflow}).
