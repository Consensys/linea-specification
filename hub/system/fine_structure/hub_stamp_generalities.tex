We impose the following general constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\hubStamp _{0} = 0$ (\sanityCheck)
	\item \label{hub: system: fine structure: hub stamp has 0/1 increments} $\hubStamp _{i + 1} \in \{ \hubStamp _{i}, 1 + \hubStamp _{i}\}$ (\sanityCheck)
	\item \If $\hubStamp _{i} =    0$ \Then $\flagSum _{i} = 0$
	\item \If $\hubStamp _{i} \neq 0$ \Then $\flagSum _{i} = 1$
\end{enumerate}
\saNote{}
The above means in particular that
$\hubStamp \equiv  0$ along padding-rows, and
$\hubStamp \not\equiv 0$ along non-padding-rows.

\saNote{}
We label constraint~(\ref{hub: system: fine structure: hub stamp has 0/1 increments})
with a ``(\sanityCheck)'' as \hubStamp{} increments will be completely described in
section~(\ref{hub: system: fine structure: hub stamp increments}),
and are verifiably always either $0$ or $1$.
