We impose that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \label{hub: system: system flags: block number starts at zero} $\blockNumber _{0} = 0$ (\sanityCheck)
	\item \blockNumber{} is \textbf{transaction-constant}
	\item \label{hub: system: system flags: block number: blocks start with sysi} \If $\blockNumber _{i + 1} \neq \blockNumber _{i}$ \Then $\sysi _{i + 1} = 1$
	\item \If $\flagSum _{i} = 1$ \Then $\blockNumber _{i + 1} = \blockNumber _{i} + \aboutToEnterSystemInit _{i}$
	\item \label{hub: system: system flags: block number: 0/1 increments} \If $\flagSum _{i} = 1$ \Then $\blockNumber _{i + 1} \in \{ \blockNumber _{i}, 1 + \blockNumber _{i} \}$ (\sanityCheck)
\end{enumerate}
\saNote{} \label{hub: system: system flags: block number increments and initial system transactions}
The above encodes the fact that every block of every conflation of blocks
must start with the execution of (one or more) \textsc{initial system transactions}.
These initial system transactions include
(\emph{a}) \cite{EIP-4788} from the \textsc{Cancun} hardfork
(\emph{b}) \cite{EIP-2935} from the \textsc{Prague} hardfork.

\saNote{}
The ``$0/1$-increments'' property for \blockNumber{} only applies to transitions between blocks of the conflation of blocks.
It does not apply to the transition from ``padding-rows'', characterized by $\flagSum _{i} = 0$,
to ``non-padding-rows'', characterized by by $\flagSum _{i} = 1$.

\saNote{}
We label constraint~(\ref {hub: system: system flags: block number starts at zero}) with a (\sanityCheck) since
\blockNumber{} is zero precisely when \flagSum{} is zero, and
\flagSum{} starts out at zero,
see section~(\ref{hub: system: system flags: generalities}).

\saNote{}
We label constraint~(\ref{hub: system: system flags: block number: 0/1 increments}) with a (\sanityCheck) since
\aboutToEnterSystemInit{} is known to only contain binary values,
see note~(\ref{hub: system: about to enter xxx flags are binary}).
