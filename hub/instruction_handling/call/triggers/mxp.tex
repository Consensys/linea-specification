We must trigger the \mxpMod{} module in every case except for that of a \staticxSH{}.
As such we impose
\[
	\locCallTriggersMxp
	\define
	\left[ \begin{array}{ll}
		+ & \locMxpx + \locOogx         \\
		+ & \scenCallUnexceptional _{i} \\
	\end{array} \right]
\]
In other words the \mxpMod{} will be triggered in all cases \emph{except for} that of a \staticxSH{}
(and of \suxSH{}'s, which are caught early on in instruction processing).

\saNote{}
$\locCallTriggersMxp$ is \textbf{provably binary}.
