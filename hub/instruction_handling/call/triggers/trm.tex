We must trigger the \trmMod{} in every case which requires us to compute the gas cost of the \inst{CALL}-type instruction. That is in case of an \oogxSH{} and in case no exception has occurred. As such we set 
\[
	\locCallTriggersTrm
	\define
	\left[ \begin{array}{cl}
		+ & \locOogx                    \\
		+ & \scenCallUnexceptional _{i} \\
	\end{array} \right]
\]
\saNote{}
$\locCallTriggersTrm$ is \textbf{provably binary}.
