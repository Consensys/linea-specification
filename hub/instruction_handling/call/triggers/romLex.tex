We must trigger the \romLexMod{} in every case which requires the execution of actual bytecode.
That is whenever the \inst{CALL}-type instruction actually gets executed and its target is an account which has nonempty bytecode. As such we set 
\[
	\locCallTriggersRomLex
	\define
	\scenCallToSmartContract_{i}
\]
\saNote{}
$\locCallTriggersRomLex$ is \textbf{provably binary}.
