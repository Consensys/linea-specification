The reader should note that what we dub
\textbf{precompile failures}\label{def: precompile failure}
are all those execution scenarios which lead to the current precompile \texttt{PRC} returning
\[
	\Xi_\texttt{PRC}
	(\bm{\sigma}, g, A, I)
	\equiv
	(\varnothing, 0, A, ())
\]
while
\textbf{precompile successes}\label{def: precompile success}
are all those execution scenarios which lead to the current precompile \texttt{PRC} returning
\[
	\Xi_\texttt{PRC}
	(\bm{\sigma}, g, A, I)
	\equiv
	(\bm{\sigma}, g - g_\text{r}, A, \textbf{o})
\]
Notations are those of the \cite{EYP-London}.

\saNote{}
Thus an \instEcrecover{} which is provided with (sufficient gas but) malformed data, preventing it from recovering an address, constitutes a ``precompile success'' (with $\textbf{o} = ()$),
while an \instEcadd{} / \instEcmul{} / \instEcpairing{} which is provided with (sufficient gas but) malformed data is considered a ``precompile failure'' (with $\textbf{o} = ()$.)
More details will be given in section~(\ref{hub: instruction handling: call: precompiles: failure classification})
