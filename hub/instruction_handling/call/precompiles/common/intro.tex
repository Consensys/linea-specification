The present section deals with the \hubMod{} processing of \emph{most} precompiles. We are able to have a rather uniform setup for the following precompiles:
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \instEcrecover{}
    \item \instShaTwo{}
    \item \instRipemd{}
    \item \instIdentity{}
    \item \instEcadd{}
    \item \instEcmul{}
    \item \instEcpairing{}
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
Despite the fact that these precompiles are rather different along several dimensions of analysis:
(\emph{a}) what constitutes success / failure
(\emph{b}) how and when to interact with \text{ram}.
These differences will re-emerge beyond the common setup phase.
