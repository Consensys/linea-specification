We deal in this section with the instruction handling of the \inst{RETURN} instruction.
This instruction is the most complex of all instructions in the \textbf{halting instruction family}.
Like \inst{STOP} and \inst{SELFDESTRUCT} it is rollback sensitive.
It can fail in complex ways.
Furthermore there are two exceptions that can \textbf{only} be triggered by \inst{RETURN} instructions (in a deployment context):
\begin{description}
	\item[\maxcsxSH{}:]
		triggered whenever attempting to deploy byte code with $ \col{code\_size} > 24576 $,
		see \cite{EIP-170};
		\specTodo{} include the \inst{CREATE} stuff;
	\item[\icpxSH{}:]
		triggered whenever attempting to deploy (nonempty) code starting with $\texttt{0xEF}$,
		see \cite{EIP-3541};
\end{description}
