We deal in this section with the instruction handling of the \inst{SELFDESTRUCT} instruction. 
This instruction is relatively complex, in particular when it comes to pricing and rollbacks.
Thus there are three scenarios for \inst{SELFDESTRUCT} instructions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the instruction \textbf{raises an exception}\footnote{either a \suxSH{}, a \staticxSH{} or an \oogxSH{}}
        \item the instruction is \textbf{unexceptional} but the current execution context \textbf{will be reverted}
        \item the instruction is \textbf{unexceptional}, the current execution context \textbf{won't be reverted} and
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item  the current account is already marked for (future) deletion\footnote{i.e. $\accMarkedForDeletion \equiv 1$}
			\item  the current account isn't yet  marked for (future) deletion\footnote{i.e. $\accMarkedForDeletion \equiv 0$}
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Thus when processing a \inst{SELFDESTRUCT} instruction we require access to the account address, the datum of whether or not it is currently under deployment or not, and if it is under deployment, we require access to the account \emph{proper}.
