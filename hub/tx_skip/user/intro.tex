In the present section we deal with transactions that don't require \textsc{evm}-execution to process. Recall that these are of two types:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item message calls to addresses with empty code;
	\item deployment transactions with empty initialization code;
\end{enumerate}
\saNote{}
Our \zkEvm{} disallows transactions which are message calls to precompiles
(i.e. transactions with $T_\text{t} \in$ \prcAddressRange),
see \ref{warning: no message calls to precompiles}.
