In the present section we deal with transactions that don't require \textsc{evm}-execution to process. Recall that these are of two types:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item message calls to addresses with empty code;
	\item deployment transactions with empty initialization code;
\end{enumerate}
\saNote{} Our \textsc{zk-evm} disallows transactions which are message calls to precompiles (i.e. transactions with $T_\text{t} \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.) See \ref{warning: no message calls to precompiles}.
