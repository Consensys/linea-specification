In the present section we deal with \textsc{final system transactions} which don't require \evm{} execution to process.
As of the \textsc{Prague} hardfork there are several such transactions:
\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{EIP-????} transactions:]
		\specTodo{} add them
\end{description}
\linea{} currently ignores all of these.
We therefore impose that
\[
	\If
	\left\{ \begin{array}{lclr}
		\totalTransactionNumber _{i} & \neq & \totalTransactionNumber _{i - 1} \\
		\sysf                   _{i} & =    & 1                                \\
	\end{array} \right.
	\Then ~
	\left\{ \begin{array}{lclr}
		\txSkip        _{i} & = & 1 & (\sanityCheck) \\
		\systemTxnNoop _{i} & = & 1 \\
	\end{array} \right.
\]
\saNote{}
The above constraint imposing ``$\txSkip \equiv 1$'' follows from
section~(\ref{hub: system: hub stamp: SYSF transactions are always SKIP}).
