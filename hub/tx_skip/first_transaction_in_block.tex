\saNote{} \label{hub: tx skip: first tx in block: why we load accounts of system smart contracts}
Before describing the contents of the following ``\textbf{system transaction}'' related rows,
we draw the attention of the reader to a quirk of our arithmetization.
Whenever a storage-row is present in the arithmetization
\textbf{a corresponding account-row must be present, too}.
By ``corresponding account-row'' we mean an account-row associated to the account whose storage is being touched.
This is a requirement given the lookup from
section~(\ref{hub: lookups: hub into hub}).
This (along with the requirement of getting the current deployment number)
explains the (seemingly useless) account-row(s) below.

		\input{tx_skip/rows/context_first_transaction}
