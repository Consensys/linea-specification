In the present section we deal with \textsc{initial system transactions} which don't require \evm{} execution to process.
As of the (\textsc{Cancun} and) \textsc{Prague} hardfork there are two such system transactions:
\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{EIP-4788} transactions:]
		\evm{} execution can be bypassed as per \cite{EIP-4788};
		such transactions simply update a storage slot with the latest \texttt{BEACONROOT};
	\item[\texttt{EIP-2935} transactions:]
		\evm{} execution can be bypassed as per \cite{EIP-2935};
		such transactions simply update a storage slot with the previouus (\linea) \texttt{BLOCKHASH};
\end{description}
