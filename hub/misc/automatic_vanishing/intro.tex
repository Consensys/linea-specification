We impose ``sanity check'' constraints that force columns belonging a sub-perspective of the $\peekMisc$-perspective to vanish when the requisite sub-perspective isn't active.
This simplifies the analysis of instructions and provides simple guarantees when constructing
e.g. \loc{trigger\_XXX} triggers from the outputs of a \loc{YYY} sub-perspective call,
which itself may or may not have been active.
Here \loc{XXX}, \loc{YYY} are understood as referring to two sub-perspectives of the $\peekMisc$-perspective, i.e. one of
\[
	\Big\{ ~ \expMod, ~ \mmuMod, ~ \mxpMod, ~ \oobMod, ~ \stpMod ~ \Big\}
\]
