We impose ``sanity check'' constraints that force columns belonging a sub-perspective (\loc{XXX}) of the $\peekMisc$-perspective
to vanish when the corresponding sub-perspective (\loc{XXX}) is inactive, as witnessed by the conjunction
\[
	\left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
		\peekMisc    _{i} & \equiv & \true  \\
		\miscXxxFlag _{i} & \equiv & \false \\
	\end{array} \right.
\]
This simplifies the analysis of instructions and provides simple guarantees when constructing
e.g. \loc{trigger\_XXX} triggers from the outputs of a \loc{YYY} sub-perspective call,
which itself may or may not have been active.
Here \loc{XXX}, \loc{YYY} are understood as referring to two sub-perspectives of the $\peekMisc$-perspective, i.e. one of
\[
	\Big\{ ~ \expMod, ~ \mmuMod, ~ \mxpMod, ~ \oobMod, ~ \stpMod ~ \Big\}
\]
