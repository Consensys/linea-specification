We consider a row permutation $\col{X}\rightsquigarrow\order{\col{X}}$ with the property that within the row-permuted columns
\[
	\Big(
	\order{\peekContext},
	\order{\cnCn},
	\order{\hubStamp},
	\order{\cnUpdate}
	\Big)
\]
(\emph{a}) padding-rows precede all non-padding-rows
(\emph{b}) all \textbf{(reordered) context-rows}\footnote{by extension rows where $\order{\peekContext} \equiv 1$} are contiguous
(\emph{c}) along the (reordered) context-rows the remaining columns are $(+, +, +)$-lexicographically ordered.

\saNote{}
The above ensures that, in the permuted realm,
(\emph{a}) all context-rows pertaining to the same execution context are contiguous,
(\emph{b}) that the rows pertaining to the same execution context-rows are sorted by ascending time stamp,
(\emph{c}) that whenever multiple context-rows pertaining to the same execution context and having the same time stamp are present,
context data is first read ($\cnUpdate \equiv 0$) before it is updated ($\cnUpdate \equiv 1$.)

\saNote{}
It is of note that several instructions may produced two context-rows of the same execution context and at the same time stamp.
This is the case for instance for
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		aborted \inst{CALL}-type instructions require two context-rows,
		one for reading the current execuction context data,
		a second one for squashing the current return data;
	\item
		\inst{CREATE(2)} instructions which raise the \textbf{failure condition $\bm{F}$}
		also require two context-rows for precisely the same reasons
		(reading the current context data followed by squashing it);
        \item
		precompile calls, where the \inst{CALL}-instruction requires reading the current context%
		\footnote{if only to check whether it is static or not}
		and a second context-row of the same context is required to update its return data with the
		output of the precompile call, all happening at the same $\hubStamp$;
\end{enumerate}
Being that these context-rows are produced at the same time stamp (i.e. same $\hubStamp$) there is a need to disambiguate them.
What the above ensures is that any context data update happens ``after'' the read.

\saNote{}
It is also of note that the extra context-row which arises from an exception (and which squashes the parent context's return data
always pertains to an execution context which is distinct from the where byte code is currently under execution, see
section~(\ref{hub: generalities: context: context numbers}),
constraint~(\ref{hub: generalities: context: exceptions lead to providing empty return data}), and
section~(\ref{hub: context rows: specialized constraints}),
definition~(\ref{hub: context rows: specialized constraints: execution provides empty return data constraint}).
