\label{rom: intro: convention: PUSHX implicitly refers to PUSH1 through PUSH32 but not PUSH0}
Throughout the specification of the \romMod{} module, whenever we write ``\inst{PUSHX}''
we will \textbf{always} be talking about the case where $\inst{X} \neq \inst{0}$,
i.e. with $\inst{X} \in \{ \inst{1}, \inst{2}, \dots, \evmWordSize \}$.
The \inst{PUSH0} instruction of \cite{EIP-3855} is dealt with differently than the other \inst{PUSHX} instructions,
see section~(\ref{rom: columns: IS_PUSH_FLAG does not light up for PUSH0}) for more details.
