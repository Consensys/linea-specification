We introduce relevant processing instructions.
Their purpose is to carry out the following comparisons:
\begin{itemize}
        \item $\locPrevBlockHashArg \leq \locCurrBlockHashArg$, expecting the result to be true
        \item $\locPrevBlockHashArg =    \locCurrBlockHashArg$
	\item $\redm{256}           \leq \absBlock$
	\item $\locCurrBlockHashArg <    \absBlock$
	\item $\locCurrBlockHashArg \geq 0 \vee \big[ \absBlock - \redm{256} \big]$ 
\end{itemize}
