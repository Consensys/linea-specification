We constrain in this section a number of ``miscellaneous transaction columns'' which don't fit in anywhere else.
We impose that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \rlpTxnCommonColumnReplayProtection{} and \rlpTxnCommonColumnYparity{} are both binary
    \item \rlpTxnCommonColumnReplayProtection{} and \rlpTxnCommonColumnYparity{} are both transaction-constant
\end{enumerate}
