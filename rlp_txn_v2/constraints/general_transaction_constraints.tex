\begin{center}
	\boxed{\text{In all this section, it is assumed that $\isTxn_{i} = 1$.}}
\end{center}

We impose:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\maxCt_{i} = 0$  
	\item $\phasend_{i} = 0$
	\item $\lc_{i} = 0$ 
	\item $\isCmp_{i+1} = 1$
\end{enumerate}

In other words, a phase always starts with one row of transaction perspective, followed by computation rows.
