- thread was started with "block missing in Shomei"
- then there is the "hub filtering" issue
	- there exist storage operations on the Besu side that don't have a hub counterpart
- Karim:
	- on devnet
	- there was a missing trie log (produced by Besu) about the coinbase address receiving its funds
	- this reward had been reflected in the state (the balance was correct (updated) in the next block)
	- this was on Maru

- the plugin may have affected the trie log
- should only affect reads (it can only add extra reads, right @gary ?, maybe also remove reads)
- in this case the writes may have been affected

- when @Roman and @Karim re-synched Besu they got the right Trie-log from Besu.


Besu + Shomei plugin (filter / clean the trie log and sends it to the SM)
State manager
in devnet Besu imported block with Shomei for the
Roman did a first sync with all of it
Besu trie log didn't contain the coinbase (Besu Shomei plugin, SM, Maru ?)
SM detected the issue
He tried to re-sync the SM, besu was still sharing the wrong TL
Re-synched Besu, and TL was correct

Now attempting to re-sync the SM
It's still synching

Issue coming from Besu (Maru + Besu + plugin)
Karim: I think it comes from the plugin, because the HUB doesn't see something and the plugin removes a valid thing
- for accounts: we trust the hub completely, and remove stuff if not hubSeen
- for storage: not trusting completely:
	- if HUB doesn't see an operation we check if it's write or read
	- if write: it's an issue that is logged
	- if read: it's ignored
- Karim: Besu is correct because of valid state root

How to understand the issues ?
- coinbase issue: 
	- monitoring
- hub filtering
	- replay the block

Question:
- is it related to a SELFDESTRUCT
	- Sepolia is still on London
	- so storage values should go to 0 if SD were the answer
- is hubSeen requesting the removal of the 0x..00 address related stuff ?
- something removed the associated trie log

Karim
- 2 issues:
- potentially linked issues
	- devnet:
		- account mising in Trie Log (TL)
		- when we send the TL to the State Manager (SM)
		- the SM detects invalidity, SM is stuck
	- sepolia:
		- besu imports a block
		- wants to generate a trie log using filtering
		- the hub says "I didn't see this write"
		- the filtering plugin doesn't accept to filter it out
		- it keeps it in its TL
		- the TL will be sent to the SM with this extra write
	- SM stuck in devnet and not sepolia
		- the filtering plugin DOES NOT remove writes to storage
		- the filtering plugin DOES     discard changes not seen by HUB for accounts
			- that seems crazy
			- maybe related to `.equals()` which is more involved for accounts

Can you give @karim links so that @karim can download the Besu and state manager databases for for devnet so that can simulate the block import that fails.
