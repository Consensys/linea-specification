The \textbf{transaction data} module \txnDataMod{} module serves several important and essentially independent functions.
For one it is the \textbf{main entry point for transaction data} contained in the \rlpTxnMod{} module into the ``execution environment" which is the \hubMod{} module.
The \txnDataMod{} also performs simple computations which occur before transaction execution proper.
These include computing the upfront gas cost of transaction,
ensuring that the gas limit covers that cost,
and ensuring that the underlying account has sufficient balance to cover both for gas cost and value transfer.
It also computes the effective gas price (for transactions implementing \cite{EIP-1559} gas semantics)
and the effective ``fee rate'' (i.e. the rate at which the \inst{COINBASE} address collects fees.)


The present module also collects select execution data, in particular as seen at the end of transaction processing.
This includes e.g. (and using notations from the \cite{EYP-London}):
\begin{enumerate}
        \item leftover gas $g'$,
        \item total gas refunds $A_\text{r}'$
        \item refundable gas \( \displaystyle g^* \equiv g' + \min\Big\{\Big\lfloor\frac{T_\text{g} - g'}\maxRefundQuotient\Big\rfloor, A_\text{r}'\Big\} \)
        \item status code $\Upsilon^z(\bm{\sigma}, T)$,
        \item cumulative gas consumption of the block of transactions up to this point $\Upsilon^u(\bm{\sigma}, T)$,
\end{enumerate}
The present module also serves the \txRequiresEvmExecution{} and \txCopyTxcd{} bits to the \hubMod{} module. 
The former is established in cooperation between the two modules while the second is deduced from the first in the present module.
