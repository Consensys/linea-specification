The \textbf{transaction data} module \txnDataMod{} module serves several important and essentially independent functions.
For one it is the \textbf{main entry point for transaction data} contained in the \rlpTxnMod{} module into the ``execution environment" which is the \hubMod{} module.

The \txnDataMod{} module performs simple computations which occur before transaction execution proper.
These include computing the upfront gas cost of transactions,
ensuring that the transaction's \textbf{gasLimit} covers that cost,
ensuring that the underlying account has sufficient balance to cover both for gas cost and value transfer,
computing the effective gas price (for transactions implementing \cite{EIP-1559} gas semantics)
and the effective ``fee rate'' (i.e. the rate at which the \inst{COINBASE} address collects fees).
The present module also (partially justifies and) serves the \txRequiresEvmExecution{} and \txCopyTxcd{} bits to the \hubMod{} module. 
The former is established in cooperation between the two modules while the second is deduced from the first in the present module.


The present module also handles computations related to finalizing transactions
such as computing adequate gas refunds.

It furthermore collects/updates block meta data
including (using notations from the \cite{EYP-London}):
\begin{enumerate}
        \item the transaction's status code $\Upsilon^z(\bm{\sigma}, T)$,
        \item the cumulative gas consumption of the block of transactions up to and including this transaction $\Upsilon^u(\bm{\sigma}, T)$,
\end{enumerate}

\saNote{}
Refunds are those of the \textsc{London} release of the \evm{}.
