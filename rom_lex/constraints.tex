We impose strict lexicographic constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \If $\cfi_{i-1} \neq 0$ \Then
	\[
		\strictLexConstraint\big[ +, +, +, - \big]
		\left(
		\begin{array}{c}
			\addrHi, \addrLo, \depNum, \depStatus; \\
			\big[@_{1}\big], \big[@_{2}\big], \big[@_{2}\big], \big[@_{4}\big]; \\
			\byteCol{$\llargeMO$}, \dots, \byteCol{1}, \byteCol{0}, \\
		\end{array}
		\right)_{i}
	\]
\end{enumerate}

\saNote{} Imposing the strict lexicographic order only if $\cfi_{i-1} \neq 0$ means we don't constrain the lexicographic order on the first non-padding rows. 
This is done on purpose, as the first non-padding rows could be the address $0x00$ with deployment number and status at 0. Having so would break the strict lexicographic order constrain.
