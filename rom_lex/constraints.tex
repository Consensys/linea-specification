We impose strict lexicographic constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \If $\cfi_{i - 1} \neq 0$ \Then
	\[
		\strictLexConstraint\big[ +, +, +, - \big]
		\left(
		\begin{array}{c}
			\addrHi, \addrLo, \depNum, \depStatus; \\
			\big[@_{1}\big], \big[@_{2}\big], \big[@_{2}\big], \big[@_{4}\big]; \\
			\byteCol{$\llargeMO$}, \dots, \byteCol{1}, \byteCol{0}, \\
		\end{array}
		\right)_{i}
	\]
\end{enumerate}

Imposing the (strict lexicographic) ordering constraint conditionally to ``$\cfi_{i - 1} \neq 0$'' means that the ordering argument applies to pairs of adjacent non-padding rows only, and not e.g. to the transition between padding rows and non-padding rows.
This is done to prevent pathologies arising when the state is pre-populated with an account at address $\texttt{0x00}$ having nontrivial byte code.
In this case the first nontrivial byte code loaded into the \romMod{} module \emph{may} have address, deployment number and deployment status all equal to 0 and $\cfi \neq 0$ (actually $\cfi = 1$),
yet the final padding row also has address, deployment number and deployment status all equal to $0$ and $\cfi = 0$.
This would break the strict lexicographic order constraint at the transition between padding and non-padding rows.

The scenario described above cannot arise organically through deployments.
