# `HUB` changes

## Columns

For the account perspective:
- new `TRANSACTION_DELEGATION_PHASE` / `TX_DLGT` (on the same level as `TX_WARM`, `TX_SKIP`, `TX_INIT`, `TX_EXEC`, `TX_FINL` transaction phases)
- new `IS_DELEGATED`                / `IS_DELEGATED_NEW`            columns
- new `DELEGATION_ADDRESS_HI`       / `DELEGATION_ADDRESS_LO`       columns
- new `DELEGATION_ADDRESS_NEW_HI`   / `DELEGATION_ADDRESS_NEW_LO`   columns
- new `DELEGATION_CODE_HASH_HI`     / `DELEGATION_CODE_HASH_LO`     columns
- new `DELEGATION_CODE_HASH_NEW_HI` / `DELEGATION_CODE_HASH_NEW_LO` columns
- constrain `IS_DELEGATED` to remain constant unless `TX_DLGT ≡ 1`
- every RLP_TXN row of `ACCOUNT_DELEGATION_DATA` type gives rise to exactly one `TX_DLGT` row
- every row does the expected delegation and sets `IS_DELEGATED_NEW` to `deleg/IS_DE_DELEGATION`
- every row does `acc/NONCE_NEW = 1 + acc/NONCE`
    - even the "sender self delegation" rows
- every row triggers the lookup to `TRM` and to `RLP_ADDR`
    - TRM:      for obvious reasons (initial prc recognition)
    - RLP_ADDR: in order that we may use this module to compute the `CODE_HASH_NEW`

Question:
- do we modify the code size ? or do we require new `DELEGATION_CODE_SIZE` / `DELEGATION_CODE_SIZE_NEW` columns
- how do we modify the recognition of EOA's for CALL's ?



- we add a new lookup `RLP_TXN -> HUB` lookup for account delegation transaction phase
    - source selector : `hub/TX_DLGT`
    - target filter   : none required


## `TX_INIT` and `TX_SKIP` changes

We have to use both `txn/NONCE` and `txn/NUMBER_OF_SENDER_SELF_DELEGATION` to compare it to `acc/NONCE` before raising it.

## Opcode changes

The following opcodes require an account row:

consider the following diagram showing how we want to populate the dummy context:

## `CODE_HASH` computation for account delegations

We will need to send stuff to some hasher. It's easiest to do this for every `TX_DLGT` row. There are various options for where to do this.
One _could_ insert MISC rows between every account row. I don't like this.
One _could_ use the lookup to RLP_ADDR which we will also trigger, send the DELEGATION_ADDRESS, too, and also request the hashing of the 'code', that is the 
following 23 bytes

    `0x ef 00 00 <delegated_address>`

## Account consistency changes

I have some questions I need confirmation on
- if an EOA account self destructs (via delegate code execution) does it maintain its delegation status ? I would imagine: YES but need to make sure
- are there any interactions with deployment numbers ? likely no
- the consistency constraints are likely obvious
